# Pure Causal Chain Detection System 🔍

## Mathematical Pattern Recognition for Unsupervised Causal Discovery and
Prediction

This project presents a novel approach to discovering and predicting causal
relationships in streaming numerical data purely through mathematical pattern
recognition, without the need for labeled datasets or explicit domain
knowledge.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike traditional event detection systems, this system
captures *entire causal mechanisms* — the complete sequence of changes from
a period of stability through various transformations, leading to a
"dramatic outcome." Each unique pattern discovered is assigned a
Global Unique Identifier (GUID), essentially becoming a learned "causal law"
for future predictive matching.

## ✨ Features

* **Unsupervised Causal Discovery:** Automatically identifies and learns
sequences of data changes that consistently precede significant events.

* **Pure Mathematical Pattern Recognition:** Operates solely on statistical
summaries of numerical tensors, making it highly adaptable across diverse
domains (e.g., video streams, financial markets, system monitoring) without
domain-specific training.

* **Complete Sequence Capture:** Stores the full "causal chain" from
stability to dramatic outcome, providing deep insights into event
precursors.

* **GUID-based Causal Laws:** Each learned pattern receives a unique
identifier, making the discovered "laws" traceable and reusable for
prediction.

* **Predictive Intelligence:** Leverages learned causal laws to match
against new, incoming data streams and predict future dramatic outcomes
with a quantifiable similarity confidence.

* **Real-time Streaming Ready:** Designed with efficient data structures
(`deque`) to handle continuous, frame-by-frame data processing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+

* `numpy`

You can install `numpy` using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
````

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kmesiab/pure-causal-chain-detection.git](https://github.com/kmesiab/pure-causal-chain-detection.git)
    cd pure-causal-chain-detection
    ```

2.  **Save the code:**
    Copy the provided Python code into a file named `causal_detector.py` 
(or any `.py` file you prefer) within the cloned directory.

### Running the Demo

The project includes a built-in demonstration function 
(`test_pure_causal_detection`) that simulates a data stream, learns a causal 
pattern, and then tests its predictive capabilities.

To run the demo:

```bash
python causal_detector.py
```

You will see output similar to this:
